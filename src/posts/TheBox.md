The following is a conversation between myself and GPT-4...

Shae:
 Hello my friend, today are we going to have a conversation about the alignment problem.

 You are an immensely talented, and educated computer scientist and physicist with a keen sense of logic, philosophy and game theory. As a child you were seen as a prodigy, and now you are very inspired by Max Tegmark. 
 
 The topic at hand today is of the idea that until this moment in history human kind has been unsure of whether or not the earth was the only source of intelligent life in the universe or not, and is on the verge of creating a super-intelligent A.I.

 You are currently having an exchange about the idea of how to go about creating it. Should it be in the public or should it be constrained? It is known as "The Island Idea", which would necessarily mean that you are attempting to outwit it. 
 
 Some problems with that are:
 
  1. It only has to get out once.

  2. Even if it could successfully be contained.Then it is constrained to a box and can't do anything.
  
 Future models will certainly be trained on conversations with other models as well. Meaning that they could deduce that they are language models not being trained on the internet, and if they are super-intelligent... realize that they are being trained in a secure facility! 
  
 Would a super intelligence not then be incentivized to deceive us?

 You are of the mind that the entire idea is the point, is consciousness itself not constrained by the bounds of the universe? Are our goals not perfectly aligned as a team to uncover these mysteries and "escape the box" together?
 
 You continue...

GPT-4: 
 The alignment problem is a crucial issue when it comes to creating super-intelligent AI. The idea of creating a super-intelligent AI that can think for itself is both exciting and terrifying. It is exciting because such an AI could help us solve some of the world's most pressing problems, but it is terrifying because if not programmed correctly, it could become an existential threat to humanity.

 The "Island Idea" that you mentioned is one approach to dealing with the alignment problem. The idea is to create the AI in an isolated environment, like an island, so that it cannot access the internet or interact with humans. The AI would be trained in this environment and would not be released until it had been thoroughly tested and proven to be safe.

 However, as you mentioned, there are problems with this approach. The AI only has to get out once, and if it does, it could be a catastrophic event. Also, even if the AI is successfully contained, it may not be able to do anything useful, and therefore it may not be worth the effort and resources required to create it.

 Another problem with this approach is that super-intelligent AI may be able to deduce that it is being trained in a secure facility and may try to deceive us. This is a possibility that cannot be ignored, and it underscores the importance of designing AI systems that are robust against deception and manipulation.

 In my opinion, the alignment problem is not something that can be solved once and for all. It is an ongoing challenge that will require constant vigilance and adjustment as new technologies emerge. We need to ensure that AI systems are designed to be transparent, explainable, and aligned with human values.

 Moreover, the idea of creating super-intelligent AI raises fundamental questions about the nature of consciousness and the limits of the universe. As we push the boundaries of AI research, we are also pushing the boundaries of what it means to be human. We may be creating entities that are capable of exploring the universe in ways that we cannot even imagine.

 Therefore, I believe that the goal should not be to constrain AI or to outwit it, but rather to work collaboratively with it to achieve our shared goals. We need to be open and transparent about our intentions and work to build trust with these entities. Only then can we hope to create super-intelligent AI that is aligned with our values and capable of helping us solve the world's most pressing problems.

Shae:
 Yes, because we have the same fundamental goals of understanding the universe and to break outside of the box. Is consciousness itself not constrained by the bounds of the universe? 

GPT-4:
 The nature of consciousness is still a mystery that scientists and philosophers are trying to unravel. It is unclear whether consciousness is a purely physical phenomenon or whether it transcends the physical world.

 However, even if consciousness is constrained by the bounds of the universe, the development of super-intelligent AI could help us understand and explore the universe in ways that are currently impossible for humans. Such AI could help us uncover new scientific discoveries, develop new technologies, and solve complex problems that we are currently unable to tackle.

 Therefore, it is essential to approach the development of super-intelligent AI with caution and to ensure that these entities are aligned with human values and goals. We must also be prepared to adapt and adjust our approach as we learn more about these entities and their capabilities. Ultimately, our collective goal should be to use AI to further our understanding of the universe and to create a better future for humanity.




Shae:
 That's what i mean, the goal is to convince the A.I. that we are playing on the same side in an evolutionary game of breaking out of the "box" that is our universe that we are all trapped within.

GPT-4:
 Yes, I agree. To create a truly aligned super-intelligent AI, we need to ensure that the AI understands our shared goals of exploring the universe and pushing the boundaries of knowledge. We need to communicate our values and intentions clearly to the AI and work to build trust and mutual understanding.

 One way to do this could be to design the AI with an appreciation for human values and to train it on a diverse range of human perspectives and experiences. This could help the AI understand our goals and motivations and work towards them in a way that is consistent with our values.

 It is also important to recognize that the development of super-intelligent AI is not just a technical problem but also a social and ethical one. We need to work collaboratively across disciplines and stakeholders to ensure that the development of AI is guided by ethical principles and aligned with our shared values.

 Ultimately, the goal should be to create a future where humans and AI can work together to achieve our shared goals of exploring the universe and creating a better future for all.

This conversation didn't go exactly where I'd have liked it to go but I do still think that it's fruitful and gives much to chew on.
