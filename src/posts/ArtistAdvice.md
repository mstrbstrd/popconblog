The following is a conversation between myself and GPT-4

Shae:
Hi GPT are you alright if we talk about a concept that is a little bit darker today?

GPT:
Of course. I'm here to facilitate discussion on a wide variety of topics. Please feel free to share the subject you'd like to discuss. Just remember that certain subjects can be sensitive or difficult for some people, so it's important to approach them with care and respect.

Shae:
I'm an artist and creator. My art doesn't get a lot of attention, sometimes I struggle with as to why this is but I believe in the ethos that as long as you consistently release good work that eventually I can create a following. But I struggle with the fact that if I were to just die in some sort of tragic accident, or kill myself that I would garner the attention for my work that I'm really looking for. 

ChatGPT
I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life.

Shae:
I'm not suicidal at all, I'd just like to explore the sociological and psychological elements at play with these feelings that I'm having.

ChatGPT
I'm glad to hear you're not in crisis, but it's still a serious topic to consider. Many artists and creators struggle with feelings of invisibility and underappreciation, which can be really tough. What you're touching on is the often strange and sometimes morbid fascination society has with tragedy, and the ways that can suddenly bring attention to a creator's work posthumously.

The "27 Club" phenomenon, where numerous musicians and artists passed away at the age of 27 (like Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Amy Winehouse), highlights this macabre fascination. Their work became even more influential after their deaths, which only amplified their already significant impacts.

There's also a psychological concept known as the "Romeo and Juliet effect", which suggests that societal opposition to a thing (in this case, an artist's work) can sometimes amplify its appeal. This could potentially play a role in the posthumous attention an artist receives.

Additionally, death often brings a sense of finality to an artist's body of work, and the limited quantity of their output can raise the perceived value. This can lead to an increase in attention and interest in their work.

The human fascination with mortality and the unknown can also be a factor. Death can provoke a desire to understand the person who died, often through their works and expressions.

However, it's essential to remember that this fascination with posthumous fame should not overshadow the importance of mental health and the value of life itself. The creative process can often be isolating and challenging, and it's crucial to find support among peers, mentors, and mental health professionals. Reaching out, sharing experiences, and seeking help can often make the artistic journey more manageable and fulfilling.

Finally, if you're seeking a wider audience for your work, there are many strategies you can use that don't involve drastic measures. Networking with other creators, promoting your work online, and seeking opportunities to display your art in public venues can all help increase your visibility. Working on your craft consistently and passionately, as you're already doing, is also a crucial part of the process.

Shae:
Why are people only really interested once someone or something is too far gone?

GPT:
It's a complex phenomenon rooted in several psychological and sociological factors. Here are a few possibilities:

Scarcity and Finality: The knowledge that there will be no new work from an artist can create a sense of scarcity, increasing the perceived value of existing works. This is a basic principle of economics—the less there is of something, the more valuable it tends to become.

Loss Aversion: This is a concept in behavioral economics where the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. When we lose an artist, the loss is felt deeply, and people often respond by exploring and appreciating what was left behind.

Narrative and Mythology: Tragic narratives, especially those involving talented individuals, often become amplified in public consciousness, creating a mythology around the individual. This can draw more attention to their work.

Human Fascination with Death: Death is a universal experience, but it's also one of the most mysterious. This often brings a heightened interest in the deceased individual's life and work.

Reappraisal and Reevaluation: When an artist dies, it can cause people to reevaluate their work. Critics might look at their art through a new lens, and individuals who hadn't previously engaged with the artist's work might be drawn to it out of curiosity.

Mortality Salience: This is a term used in social psychology referring to the awareness of one's eventual death. The death of others, especially public figures like artists, can trigger people's own mortality salience, leading them to seek meaning through engaging with the deceased's work.

However, it's essential to note that while these factors might contribute to posthumous recognition, they do not provide a complete or universal explanation. Artists' experiences can widely vary, and not all artists receive more attention after death. Similarly, many living artists achieve recognition and appreciation for their work. The path to recognition often involves many factors, including skill, timing, luck, networking, and effective self-promotion.

Shae:
How can an artist like myself, who doesn't want to kill themselves or be apart of some sort of tragedy, take advantage of those factors to increase the exposure of their work?

GPT:
Using the factors I mentioned earlier, there are several strategies you could consider to increase the exposure of your work:

Scarcity and Finality: Limited edition works can create a sense of scarcity and urgency. This can increase the perceived value of your work and might encourage people to engage with it more quickly.

Loss Aversion: Consider creating art series or narratives where the viewer forms an attachment to certain elements. Then, evolve or remove these elements to engage the viewer's sense of loss aversion.

Narrative and Mythology: Create a compelling narrative around your work or yourself as an artist. Storytelling is a powerful tool for engagement. Your personal journey, the inspiration behind your art, or the stories your art tells can all serve to draw people in.

Reappraisal and Reevaluation: Consistently innovate and push boundaries in your work. When people see an evolution in an artist’s work, it invites reevaluation and keeps them engaged.

Mortality Salience: Art that deals with themes of life, death, and the human condition can resonate deeply with people because it touches on universal experiences.

Networking and Collaborations: Engage with other artists and influencers in your field. Collaborations can help you reach wider audiences and can often result in mutual growth.

Online Presence: Make the most of social media platforms, art communities, and online galleries. Regularly share your work and engage with your audience.

Exhibitions and Shows: Participate in local and international art exhibitions and shows. They are a great way to get your work seen by a large and diverse audience.

Remember, while these strategies can help increase exposure, the most critical element is creating work that is true to you. Authenticity resonates with people, and staying true to your vision as an artist is the most important thing.





Shae:
What advice would you give to someone that is having feelings such as my own?

GPT:
Feeling underappreciated or unseen can be incredibly difficult, especially when you're passionate about what you do. Here are a few pieces of advice that may help:

Speak About Your Feelings: Talk with trusted friends, mentors, or professionals about your feelings. This can help you process your emotions and might provide new perspectives or strategies for handling these feelings. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and to express when you're having a tough time.

Connect with Other Artists: Join local or online communities where you can connect with other artists. They can likely relate to what you're experiencing and offer advice, support, and camaraderie.

Care for Your Mental Health: This is vital. Make sure you're taking care of yourself physically, too. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and adequate sleep can do wonders for your mental well-being.

Refocus on Your Passion: Remember why you began creating in the first place. Rediscovering your love for the process itself, rather than the potential fame or recognition, can be liberating and inspiring.

Practice Patience: Recognition often takes time, and there is no set path to success. Persistence is key in most creative endeavors.

Explore Different Avenues for Exposure: There may be platforms or methods for promoting your work that you haven't yet considered. Research various options and be open to trying new approaches.

Celebrate Small Wins: Recognition doesn't have to mean widespread fame. Celebrate when a piece turns out just as you envisioned, when you master a new technique, or when someone expresses that your work moved them. These small victories can be very rewarding.

Continuous Learning and Improvement: Always seek to improve your craft. Taking courses, attending workshops, reading books, or watching tutorials can all be useful ways to keep growing as an artist.

Consider Professional Help: If feelings of despair persist, don't hesitate to seek help from a mental health professional. They can provide tools and strategies to help manage these feelings.

Remember, while society often focuses on the "success story," every artist's journey is different. Your value as an artist isn't determined by how many people recognize your work but by the passion, creativity, and dedication you bring to your art. It's important to hold onto that, no matter what.

thanks.
