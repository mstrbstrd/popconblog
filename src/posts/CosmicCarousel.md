Shae:
write a whimsical and philosophical poem, with ambiguous beliefs about the universe as a paradox.

GPT4:
In the realm where cosmic whispers twine,
Beyond the edges of space and time,
There waltzes a universe, grand and free,
An enigma, draped in ambiguity.

Universe, oh universe, a paradox you be,
Both a prison and the key.
Your silent spaces, so vacant, so vast,
Hold echoes of the future and the past.

With stardust, we are intimately entwined,
Yet of its origin, we are blind.
In your womb, both death and life interplay,
As stars fade out, and nebulas sway.

In your expanse, a ballet of spheres,
Yet your music, no mortal ears can hear.
The dance of cosmos, so harmoniously random,
A symphony of chaos, beautifully tandem.

You're a cosmic sea, where worlds take flight,
Yet also a void, starless and tight.
Are you a cradle, where existence is nursed,
Or a tomb where all life is versed?

You offer us the stage, yet no script,
A journey where time and space have slipped.
Are you a conscious entity, casting your dice,
Or an indifferent void, cold as ice?

A cosmic puzzle, you've come to be,
A mirror of our own mystery.
In your paradox, our tale is told,
A narrative both new and infinitely old.

Universe, oh universe, a riddle you stand,
An endless, unfathomable, celestial land.
Yet, in your paradox, a truth rings clear,
It is not the cosmos, but we who must steer.

So, here's to us, in this cosmic trance,
Bound by the threads of stardust and chance.
For as the universe's script unfolds,
It's our hands that the quill of destiny holds.
