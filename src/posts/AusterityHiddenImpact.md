Part 1: The Great War and the Crisis in the UK and Italy

During the first World War, societies in both the United Kingdom and Italy faced a crisis as the free market's inability to provide essential goods and services became apparent. The state had previously propped up the industrialist and ownership class, but during the war, it took over factories and entire industries in the name of winning the war. This revelation that the invisible hand of the market was a fraud the whole time led to widespread dissatisfaction among the working class, resulting in historic popular uprisings and general strikes. People demanded more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.

In the post-WW1 era, events like the Italian general strike served as a "ghost of Christmas future" for capitalists, much like Scrooge's vision. However  instead of realizing their wrongs and turning a new leaf, this realization spurred on the invention and implementation of austerity measures to prevent their own demise.

Part 2: Austerity Measures and their Three Pillars

Austerity, in simple terms, refers to a set of government policies aimed at reducing spending and budget deficits. This usually involves cutting public services, reducing welfare benefits, and sometimes raising taxes. There are three pillars of austerity: monetary, fiscal, and industrial. Monetary austerity focuses on controlling inflation and stabilizing currency by implementing higher interest rates and restrictive monetary policies, such as reducing the money supply. Fiscal austerity involves reducing government spending, cutting public services, and raising taxes to decrease budget deficits. Industrial austerity encompasses wage suppression, reduced workers' rights, and increased production quotas to enhance competitiveness and productivity. These three aspects of austerity work together to achieve the goals of economic stabilization and fiscal responsibility.

These austerity measures, in combination, serve the purpose of subduing the working class and transferring wealth to the industrialists and ownership class. By suppressing wages, curbing social benefits, and limiting bargaining power, governments effectively shift wealth from the working class to the upper class, exacerbating income inequality and reinforcing existing power structures.

Part 3: Technocracy and its Implications

To distance the public from the ability to engage in a meaningful discussion on austerity, the idea of technocracy was introduced. Technocracy is a system that separates politics from economics and prioritizes efficiency and competence over partisan interests. This approach made it challenging for the public to scrutinize austerity measures and their implications.

However, the use of the term "competence" within the definition of technocracy has its own nefarious implications. In an unequal society, achieving competence often means being a product of the very institutions that perpetuate systemic inequalities. Those who attain positions of power within a technocratic system may have received their education and training from elite institutions that reinforce existing social hierarchies and perpetuate the status quo.

This issue raises concerns about the true impartiality and fairness of a technocratic system. By valuing competence as defined by these institutions, technocracy may inadvertently favor individuals who have benefited from existing inequalities and are, therefore, more likely to uphold them. As a result, technocracy can become another tool for maintaining the power dynamics that underpin austerity measures, rather than a genuinely neutral and efficient approach to economic management.

To address this problem, it is essential to recognize that competence should not be solely defined by one's education or institutional affiliations. Instead, we must broaden our understanding of competence to include diverse perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds. By doing so, we can ensure that technocratic systems genuinely serve the interests of all citizens and contribute to a more equitable and just society.

Part 4: Challenges in Our Post-COVID World

In our post-COVID world, we face similar challenges to those of the past. The pandemic has laid bare the limitations of the free market, revealing that the government can indeed directly impact the lives of average people. However, in many cases, governments have opted to maintain the illusion of the free market rather than providing the necessary support to their citizens.

One of the primary issues we face today is inflation, which is partly driven by corporate price gouging and supply-side economics. Rather than addressing the root causes of these problems, governments often resort to austerity measures in an attempt to combat inflation. This approach is akin to using a hammer to fix a delicate piece of machinery - it may have some effect, but ultimately, it's the wrong tool for the job.

As individuals have witnessed the government's capacity to intervene during the COVID-19 crisis, they have become more critical of how the state chooses to allocate resources and prioritize certain interests. This renewed interest in the state's role has sparked discussions about the effectiveness of the current economic system and whether it truly serves the needs of the majority.

Inflationary pressures and corporate practices that prioritize profits over public welfare are issues that cannot be resolved through austerity measures alone. To create a more equitable and sustainable future, we must challenge the existing economic system and implement policies that prioritize the needs of all citizens, not just the interests of a select few. By learning from history and recognizing the inherent flaws in our current approach, we can work towards building a more just and fair society for everyone.

Part 5: Inspiring Change in the 21st Century

So, what can the average person do to inspire change in the 21st century?

1. Stay informed and engaged in political and economic discussions. By understanding these issues' complexities, individuals can advocate for policies that prioritize the majority's welfare over a select few's interests.

2. Support grassroots movements and organizations that work towards a more equitable society. By participating in collective action, we can amplify our voices and influence policy changes at local, national, and international levels.

3. Cultivate a culture of empathy, compassion, and solidarity. Recognizing our shared struggles and aspirations allows us to work together to build a world that is fairer and more just for all.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the post-World War I era in the UK and Italy teaches us valuable lessons about the consequences of an unchecked free market and the power of collective action. By learning from our history and adapting our approach, we can pave the way for a more equitable and sustainable future.

If you're interested in learning more about Austerity and the history of it's implementation as well as the class struggles of the post WW1 era I strongly suggest reading The Capital Order: How Economists Invented Austerity and Paved the Way to Fascism by Clara E. Mattei. It is an excellent read but fair warning, if you are like me it will make you very angry.

Cheers,
Shae.
