Problem Statement
The digital transformation of the 21st century has opened up a world of possibilities, reshaping societies and how individuals interact. Despite these numerous benefits, this new digital era has introduced complex challenges, often threatening societal harmony, personal privacy, and the sanctity of public discourse. To address these growing concerns, we propose "Popular Consensus" - a comprehensive solution targeting three interrelated problems: societal polarization, the growing mistrust in social media platforms, and the ethical quandaries posed by artificial intelligence.
Societal Polarization
The intensification of societal polarization, wherein public opinion diverges towards extremes, has become a significant concern in recent times. Instead of nurturing balanced discourse, many digital platforms inadvertently create echo chambers, offering information that predominantly aligns with users' existing beliefs. Engagement-driven algorithms used by these platforms prioritize sensationalism over truth, thereby promoting divisive content. This situation not only exacerbates societal divisions but also fosters misperceptions of public consensus, as radical viewpoints are amplified disproportionately. The 2016 U.S. Presidential Election provides a salient example, where polarized opinions and divisive rhetoric were amplified by social media platforms, resulting in a society plagued by deep divisions.
Distrust in Social Media Platforms
The trust in digital and social media platforms has significantly deteriorated over the past decade. Data privacy violations, misuse of personal information, the spread of misinformation, and opaque content algorithms have all contributed to this decline. The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 highlights these issues. It showed how the personal data of millions could be harvested without consent, spurring a global dialogue about privacy and trust in social media platforms. Trust serves as the bedrock of discourse; its absence impedes open and constructive dialogue, fostering skepticism and defensiveness.
The Impact of Artificial Intelligence
While artificial intelligence (AI) offers immense potential, it also introduces complex challenges. Machine learning algorithms, potent yet lacking discernment, can inadvertently amplify biases embedded in their training data. This amplification perpetuates societal disparities and, in certain instances, exacerbates them. For instance, an AI trained on a biased dataset might continue to propagate these biases, skewing the perceived societal consensus. The lack of transparency in many AI models, often referred to as the 'black box' problem, breeds distrust and confusion. A clear illustration of this is the controversy surrounding the use of AI in judicial systems, where algorithms predicting future criminal behavior have shown bias against specific demographic groups.
These three interrelated issues pose a formidable barrier to creating a balanced, representative, and trustworthy digital public sphere. Existing solutions fall short, underscoring the need for a novel platform designed to address these concerns in a comprehensive and effective manner. Our solution, "Popular Consensus," aspires to confront these challenges, leveraging cutting-edge technology and committing to principles of transparency, fairness, and inclusivity.
A New Proposition: Popular Consensus as an API for Humanity’s Opinions
Taking a step further, we envision "Popular Consensus" not merely as a platform but as an API that encapsulates the collective opinions of humanity. In a world moving swiftly towards artificial general intelligence (AGI), this API could serve as an indispensable reference point, enabling AGIs to access, understand, and respect human opinions across an array of topics. It's akin to creating a digital 'bill of opinions', providing AGIs with a comprehensive understanding of human perspectives. This innovative concept can help ensure that AGIs take into account the complexity and diversity of human opinions while making decisions, further reinforcing the ethical application of AI.



Solution

Our solution, the "Popular Consensus" platform, represents an innovative approach to collective dialogue and decision-making. By combining cutting-edge technologies with robust ethical principles, it provides a comprehensive answer to the identified issues of societal polarization, mistrust in social media, and the predicaments brought about by artificial intelligence.
Blockchain for Transparency and Trust
The backbone of "Popular Consensus" is blockchain technology, which brings about unparalleled transparency and trust. With blockchain, each transaction is trackable, verifiable, and permanent, effectively negating the opaque operations typically linked with traditional social media algorithms. Such transparency underpins the rebuilding of user trust, mirroring the transparency found in the Bitcoin network, where every transaction is open for verification.
Decentralization for Inclusivity and Resistance to Manipulation
Embracing a decentralized model, the platform ensures that power and control are equitably distributed among users. This setup counters societal polarization by enabling every voice to be heard, irrespective of political or social standing. Decentralization also offers robust resistance to system manipulation by any single entity, thereby bolstering fairness and equality. The decentralized nature of the internet, which promotes freedom and inclusivity as no single entity has control, offers a fitting parallel.
Privacy-Preserving Technology for Data Security
To further cultivate trust, "Popular Consensus" employs sophisticated privacy-preserving technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs. Users can partake in vital discourse and vote on issues without fear of personal data misuse. Even while contributing to the broader societal conversation, their privacy remains intact, echoing privacy-centric platforms like Signal, where end-to-end encryption safeguards user conversations.
AI for Balanced Representation
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is pivotal to "Popular Consensus," albeit in a distinct way from traditional platforms. Rather than exploiting AI to boost user engagement - often leading to the promotion of extreme viewpoints - the AI within "Popular Consensus" is purposefully designed to foster balanced and inclusive representation. AI assists in recognizing and mitigating potential biases, ensuring that the platform remains an accurate mirror of collective opinions.
Incentivization for Engagement and Data Unions
To stimulate user participation, "Popular Consensus" introduces a token-based incentive mechanism. Users earn tokens by partaking in productive discussions, creating insightful content, or participating in decision-making processes. These tokens not only offer a sense of accomplishment but also play a role in platform governance, thus fostering a dynamic and engaged community.
Crucially, "Popular Consensus" also incorporates the concept of Data Unions. Users have the option to sell their tokens on the open market, thereby profiting from their engagement. Furthermore, users own the polls they create. If a poll attracts significant attention and accumulates millions of votes, the poll owner can choose to sell the data derived from that poll. This action generates a profit for both the poll owner and the individual voters, thereby creating a more equitable distribution of the financial benefits generated by the platform.
In summary, "Popular Consensus" serves as more than a mere platform; it's a tool akin to an API, available to individuals, communities, municipalities, governments, corporations, or even AI, to seek the popular consensus on any topic. Designed as a public utility, it offers a common ground where the collective views of humanity can be accessed and understood, fostering a more balanced, inclusive, and empathetic society. With its incorporation of blockchain, decentralization, privacy-preserving technologies, AI, incentivization, and Data Unions, "Popular Consensus" offers a comprehensive and novel solution to the issues currently plaguing digital discourse. It paves a new path towards a more representative, trustworthy, and constructive digital public sphere.

By focusing on these strategies, we aim to create a vibrant, active, and diverse community on the "Popular Consensus" platform.

Governance Model

The "Popular Consensus" initiative will employ a governance model that combines community-driven decision-making with strategic guidance from an appointed board of directors at first, with the goal of becoming a self-sustaining DAO. A key component of this model is the use of a Token Curated Registry (TCR), which incentivizes active participation and ensures quality control.
1. Board of Directors: The board will be responsible for the overall strategy and direction of the initiative. It will include experts from various fields, such as technology, social sciences, legal, and ethics, ensuring a balanced and holistic approach to platform development and operation. The initial board members will be selected by the founding team based on their expertise, experience, and commitment to the mission of the initiative. The board will make decisions through a majority vote, with each member having one vote. As the platform evolves towards a DAO, the community will gradually take over the selection of board members through token-based voting.
2. Community Governance: The platform will use token-based voting for key decisions, allowing active participants to influence the platform's future direction. This not only incentivizes active participation but also ensures that the platform continually evolves to meet its users' needs and expectations. The specifics of the voting process, including the weight of votes and the minimum participation threshold for a vote to be valid, will be defined in the platform's governance policy. This is where the TCR comes into play, providing a decentralized mechanism for curating the platform's content and decision-making processes.
3. Token Curated Registry (TCR): A TCR is a decentralized model that uses tokens to incentivize the curation of lists. In the context of our platform, the TCR will be used to curate content, moderate discussions, and make key decisions. Token holders will have a stake in maintaining the platform's quality and integrity, as the value of their tokens is tied to the platform's reputation. This creates a self-regulating system where users are motivated to act in the best interest of the platform.
4. Content Moderation: Content curation and moderation will be a community-led effort, guided by a set of clear and transparent rules. AI will be utilized to support this process, identifying potential issues that need human review. The community, through token-based voting and the TCR, will have the ability to revise and update these rules to ensure they remain relevant and effective.
Continuing on the next sections, Funding Sources, Legal Framework, Impact Assessment, and Implementation Plan will further elucidate the proposed structure and plan for the "Popular Consensus" initiative.

Funding Sources
The initial funding for the "Popular Consensus" initiative will be sought from a variety of sources, including grants, philanthropic donations, and possible early-stage investment from individuals or organizations that support the platform's mission. This seed funding will cover the costs of the initial development, operational setup, and marketing efforts.
1. Grants: We will apply for grants from foundations and governments that support initiatives aimed at enhancing civic engagement, improving public discourse, or leveraging technology for societal benefit. We anticipate needing approximately $500,000 in grant funding for the first two years of operation.
2. Philanthropic Donations: We will reach out to philanthropic organizations, high net-worth individuals, and the general public who believe in our mission and are willing to make contributions to help kickstart the initiative. Our goal is to raise $200,000 through donations in the first year.
3. Early-stage Investment: We may also consider accepting investments from individuals or organizations that understand and support our long-term vision. These investors should align with our values and principles, particularly with respect to our commitment to maintaining user privacy, operating transparently, and prioritizing societal benefit over profit. We aim to secure $300,000 in early-stage investment within the first 18 months.
However, the long-term financial sustainability of the "Popular Consensus" platform will be designed around a self-sustaining model that operates at cost. Here's how we plan to achieve this:
4. Data Union: With user consent, anonymized aggregate data can be sold through a Data Union. The revenue generated from this can be used to cover operational costs. Users will be able to opt-in or opt-out of this sharing, and their participation will not impact their ability to use the platform or its features.
5. Microtransactions: For certain premium features, small transaction fees could be introduced. These features could include in-depth analytics, advanced customization, or other enhancements that go beyond the basic free functionality of the platform. The goal here is not to create a paywall that restricts access, but rather to offer additional value that some users might be willing to pay for. These fees will be carefully balanced to cover costs without becoming a barrier to usage.
6. Sponsorships and Partnerships: Ethical sponsorships and partnerships could be another source of income. For example, organizations might sponsor public interest debates, educational programs, or other activities aligned with the platform's mission. We will ensure that these sponsorships do not influence the platform's independence or bias its content.
In implementing these funding sources, our guiding principle will be to prioritize the public good and user interests over profit. We will ensure complete transparency in how funds are used, and any surplus will be reinvested back into the platform to improve its functionality, accessibility, and overall user experience. We anticipate that the platform will become financially self-sustaining within five years of launch.

Legal Framework
The "Popular Consensus" platform will be established as a non-profit organization, specifically designed as a public utility for the benefit of the community. The legal framework will be designed to support our mission, facilitate our operations, and protect the rights and interests of all stakeholders.
1. Non-Profit Status: Registering as a non-profit entity will ensure our commitment to serving the public interest. In the United States, for instance, this would involve filing as a 501(c)(3) organization, which is exempt from federal income tax and allows for tax-deductible donations. The exact procedure and requirements will depend on the jurisdiction in which we incorporate.
2. Data Privacy and User Rights: Given that our operations revolve around user-generated data, the legal framework must be built around protecting user data and privacy rights. We will comply with relevant data protection laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the U.S. Users will have full control over their data and will be able to opt-in or opt-out of data sharing with the Data Union.
3. Intellectual Property Rights: We will ensure that intellectual property rights are respected on our platform. Users who contribute content will retain the rights to their contributions, and we will implement measures to prevent unauthorized use or distribution of copyrighted material.
4. Governance and Accountability: As a decentralized platform, the legal framework must also address governance. We will establish a Board of Directors and develop a set of bylaws that lay out the governance structure, decision-making processes, and accountability measures. The blockchain technology itself provides a high level of transparency and auditability, which will help enforce these rules.
5. Risk Management and Liability: The legal framework will also cover risk management and liability issues. This includes developing policies for conflict resolution and dispute management, defining the platform's liability in various scenarios, and ensuring we have appropriate insurance coverage.
6. Compliance with Local and International Laws: Finally, as we aim for a global presence, we will need to ensure that we comply with local laws and regulations in all jurisdictions where we operate. This will involve legal expertise in international law and may require us to adapt our operations and policies in response to different legal environments.
7. Token Regulation: As the platform will be using a token-based system for governance and incentivization, it's important to clarify the legal status of these tokens. Depending on the jurisdiction, they may be classified as securities, commodities, or another type of asset, each of which comes with its own regulatory requirements.
8. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Laws: As the platform aims to transition into a DAO, it's crucial to understand and comply with the emerging laws and regulations around DAOs. This includes the legal status of DAOs, the rights and responsibilities of token holders, and the legal implications of decisions made through decentralized voting.
9. Content Moderation and Liability: While the platform aims to be community-led and decentralized, there may still be legal considerations around content moderation, especially when it comes to illegal content or behavior. The platform will need to strike a balance between decentralization and compliance with laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) or Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the U.S.
10. Cross-Border Data Transfers: As a global platform, "Popular Consensus" will likely involve transferring user data across national borders. This can be a complex area of law, particularly given recent developments like the invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. The platform will need to ensure it has a legal basis for these transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Binding Corporate Rules.

Impact Assessment
The impact of the "Popular Consensus" platform will be evaluated through a comprehensive approach that encompasses both quantitative and qualitative measures. This will allow us to assess how effectively the platform is addressing its mission and objectives, and to communicate these results to stakeholders and the public in a transparent and accountable manner.
1. User Engagement Metrics: Key performance indicators such as the number of active users, user retention rate, and user participation in discussions and voting activities will be regularly monitored. These metrics will provide insight into the platform's ability to attract and engage users over time. For instance, achieving a user base representing at least 10% of the global internet-using population within the first year would be a significant milestone towards our larger goal.
2. Diversity of Opinions Represented: We aim to promote diverse viewpoints and foster a balanced discussion. Metrics such as the diversity of issues discussed, the representation of different demographic groups, and the sentiment analysis of discussions can help us gauge the platform's success in this regard. A measurable goal could be to ensure that at least 10% of active users come from traditionally underrepresented groups within the first year, as a step towards our larger goal.
3. Constructive Dialogue and Dispute Resolution: One of our core objectives is to promote respectful and constructive dialogue. To measure this, we'll use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the quality of discussions. We will also track the number and outcomes of disputes resolved through the platform's mediation system. A measurable goal could be to maintain a user-reported satisfaction rate of above 70% regarding the quality of discussions within the first year.
4. Impact on Public Discourse and Policy Making: To evaluate the platform's broader societal impact, we'll conduct periodic surveys and partner with independent researchers to assess how the platform is influencing public discourse and, potentially, policy making. This could include case studies where popular consensus on our platform has led to noticeable changes in public policies or corporate decisions.
5. Privacy and Data Security: Given our focus on user privacy and data security, we will also track incidents related to data breaches or unauthorized data access. The goal is to maintain these occurrences at zero, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data security measures.
6. Self-Sustainability Metrics: As the platform aims to operate at cost and achieve self-sustainability, we'll monitor financial metrics such as revenue growth, operating costs, and the balance of donations/grants. These figures will help us assess the financial health and sustainability of the organization.
7. User Satisfaction and Trust: Finally, user surveys will be conducted to gauge user satisfaction and trust in the platform. These surveys can provide valuable feedback on various aspects of the platform, such as usability, perceived fairness, and effectiveness of the consensus-building process.
This robust impact assessment framework will allow us to monitor our performance, make data-driven decisions, and demonstrate our effectiveness to stakeholders and the broader public. We will regularly share these results with our community and stakeholders, reinforcing our commitment to transparency and accountability.
